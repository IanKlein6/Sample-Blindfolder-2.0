## 🧾 **BlindFolder 2.0 Debugging Session Log**

**Date:** June 30, 2025
**Participants:** Ian Klein, ChatGPT

---

### 1. **Initial Problem Description**

You were trying to launch the built version of your Electron app (`BlindFolder 2.0`) from the macOS terminal and encountered several issues:

* `zsh: permission denied` trying to execute the build folder
* `no such file or directory` when trying to run `Blindfolder 2.0` binary directly
* Successfully ran the `.app` via `open` but the app failed to function as expected.

---

### 2. **Symptoms Identified**

* The app launched but didn't perform actions triggered via the **native menu** (e.g., "Select Folder(s)", "Select Destination").
* Buttons in the UI worked (e.g., `handleAddFolder()` via UI triggered IPC correctly).
* Menu items triggered no visible action or logs.
* Console output showed:

  ```bash
  Console message: Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'selectFolders')
  ```
* The **preload script was not found** in the bundled `.asar`:

  ```
  Unable to load preload script: preload.js not found in app.asar
  ```

---

### 3. **Root Cause Analysis**

You discovered that:

* Your `preload.js` file was missing from the production `app.asar` package.
* This caused `window.electronAPI` to be `undefined` inside the renderer (React).
* Your React app was calling `window.electronAPI.selectFolders()` and failing silently from the menu, while buttons still worked because they might've been wired differently in dev.

---

### 4. **Solutions Implemented**

#### ✅ Added `preload.js` to `electron-builder` config

In `package.json`:

```json
"files": [
  "main.js",
  "preload.js",  // ← Added this line
  "electron.js",
  "utils/**/*",
  "node_modules/**/*",
  "blindfolder-ui/build/**/*"
]
```

#### ✅ Defined preload API correctly

Your `preload.js` file was implemented like this:

```js
const { contextBridge, ipcRenderer } = require('electron');

contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld('electronAPI', {
  selectFolders: () => ipcRenderer.invoke('select-folders'),
  selectDestination: () => ipcRenderer.invoke('select-destination'),
  processFolders: (data) => ipcRenderer.invoke('process-folders', data),
  openFolder: (path) => ipcRenderer.invoke('open-folder', path),

  // Menu-triggered events
  onMenuSelectFolders: (callback) => ipcRenderer.on('menu-select-folders', callback),
  onMenuSelectDestination: (callback) => ipcRenderer.on('menu-select-destination', callback),
});
```

#### ✅ React App `useEffect` for menu integration

You added this to your `App.js`:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  const handleMenuSelectFolders = () => handleAddFolder();
  const handleMenuSelectDestination = () => handleRename();

  window.electronAPI?.onMenuSelectFolders(handleMenuSelectFolders);
  window.electronAPI?.onMenuSelectDestination(handleMenuSelectDestination);

  return () => {
    window.electronAPI?.onMenuSelectFolders?.removeListener?.(handleMenuSelectFolders);
    window.electronAPI?.onMenuSelectDestination?.removeListener?.(handleMenuSelectDestination);
  };
}, []);
```

#### ✅ Rebuilt React

You realized that you hadn't recompiled your React app (`npm run build`) after updating `preload.js`, so the old static JS bundle was still using stale references (`window.electron` or `undefined`). After rebuilding React and repackaging Electron, the menu started working.

---

### 5. **Final Outcome**

* ✅ `Select Folder(s)` and `Select Destination` now work from the **native menu**.
* ✅ `preload.js` loads correctly from the `.asar` bundle.
* ✅ React UI and Electron IPC communication are now fully functional.
* ✅ Error logs are visible, and app feedback works as expected.

---

### 6. **Suggested Improvements Going Forward**

* Automate your build process to always run `npm run build` for React before `electron-builder`.
* Consider using `debug()` or your custom logger consistently throughout both main and renderer for visibility.
* Optionally test with `asar: false` for easier debugging during development builds.
